# Home Assistant Add-on: Open Do単ita add-on

The [Open Do単ita server](https://gitlab.com/rastersoft/opendonita) add-on for Home Assistant.

## Compatibility

OpenDo単ita is a server designed to work with the Conga 1390/1490/1590 robotic vacuum cleaners distributed by Cecotec in Spain. Since it is really a robot manufactured by the chinese company robot bona, it is very probable that it would work with other robots.

## Installation

You will need to pair your Conga with your server, follow the instructions 
found on the [Open Do単ita server site](https://gitlab.com/rastersoft/opendonita).
